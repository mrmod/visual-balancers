# visual-balancers

Simple sort of example for displaying a diagram of the flow of traffice from the internet to EC2 LB load balancer target.

Improvements would be rotating the text labels on the links to be parallel to the bar or creating a separate link for each ingress range from the security group to the load balancer.
